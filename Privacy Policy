3. WiFi Use
Color Music uses WiFi to transmit audio data between your device and any connected lights. The app does not require or use cellular data, Bluetooth, or any other form of location tracking.

4. Data Retention
No data is retained or stored after the app is closed. Audio data is only processed for the duration of the app’s use and is not kept afterward.
